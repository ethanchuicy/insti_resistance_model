# Linear Regression Model for INSTI resistance

This repository contains code and dataset used in the publication:  
Machine Learning Prediction of HIV1 Drug Resistance against Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors, Ching Yu Chui and A.W. Edith Chan, submitted to Biomed Research International (Wiley), 2025.

## Overview
A logistic regression model was used in the above publication to look at INSTI resistance patterns in HIV integrase.

## Files
model.ipynb: Main notebook used for training and evaluation  
integrase_dataset: resistance fold change data and mutations tested  
Chui_HIV_Supplementary: mutation frequency, solvent accessible area, secondary structure and binding site data for each residue
